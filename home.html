      <strong>Software development</strong> does not stop when a system is
      delivered but continues throughout the lifetime of the system. After a
      system has been deployed, it inevitably has to change if it is to
      remain useful. Business changes and changes to user expectations
      generate new requirements for the existing software.
    </p>

    <p>
      Software evolution is important because organizations have invested
      large amounts of money in their software and are now completely
      dependent on these systems. Their systems are critical business assets
      and they have to invest in system change to maintain the value of
      these assets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Studies of software evolution show that, on average, over 50% of the
      costs of a software system are spent on system change after the system
      has been deployed (Jones, 2008). For large systems, this proportion may
      be as high as 80%. Therefore, if you are involved in software
      development, you should expect to spend more time and money on system
      change than on initial development.
    <p>
      Software evolution may be triggered by changing business requirements,
      by reports of software defects, or by changes to other systems in a
      software system’s environment. <strong>Hopkins and Jenkins (2008)</strong> coined
      the term <i>‘brownfield software development’</i> to describe
      situations in which software systems have to be developed and managed
      in an environment where they depend on many other software systems.

    <div class="font-bold text-lg">The Spiral Model</div>
    <p>
      You should, therefore, think of software engineering as a spiral
      process with requirements, design, implementation, and testing going
      on throughout the lifetime of the system.
    </p>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      This model of software evolution implies that a single organization is
      responsible for both the initial software development and the
      evolution of the software.
    </p>
    <p>
      In practice, this is often not the case. Many software systems are
      developed by one organization and then sold to another organization
      that is responsible for the evolution of the system. This is true of
      most packaged software systems.
    <div class="font-bold ">Evolution vs. Servicing</div>
    <p>
      Rajlich and Bennett (2000) proposed an alternative view of the
      software evolution life cycle, distinguishing between <strong>evolution</strong>
      and <strong>servicing</strong>.
    </p>

   
    <figure class="flex flex-col items-center my-8">
      <img src="images/Figure2.png" alt="Figure 9.2 Evolution and servicing">
      <figcaption class="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">
        Figure 9.2 — Evolution and servicing
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    
    <figure class="flex flex-col items-center my-8">
      <img src="images/Figure3.png" alt="Figure 9.3 Change identification and evolution processes">
      <figcaption class="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">
        Figure 9.3 — Change identification and evolution processes
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      In this model, the software is initially developed and then enters an
      evolution phase in which it is changed to meet new requirements. The
      evolution process continues until the costs of changing the software
      exceed the value that these changes provide.
