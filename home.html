          <strong>Software development</strong> does not stop when a system is
          delivered but continues throughout the lifetime of the system. After a
          system has been deployed, it inevitably has to change if it is to
          remain useful. Business changes and changes to user expectations
          generate new requirements for the existing software. Parts of the
          software may have to be modified to correct errors that are found in
          operation, to adapt it for changes to its hardware and software
          platform, and to improve its performance or other non-functional
          characteristics.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          <strong>Software evolution</strong> is important because organizations
          have invested large amounts of money in their software and are now
          completely dependent on these systems. Their systems are critical
          business assets and they have to invest in system change to maintain
          the value of these assets. Consequently, most large companies spend
          more on maintaining existing systems than on new systems development.
          Based on an informal industry poll, Erlikh (2000) suggests that 85–90%
          of organiza tional software costs are evolution costs. Other surveys
          suggest that about two-thirds of software costs are evolution costs.
          For sure, the costs of software change are a large part of the IT
          budget for all companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Studies of software evolution show that, on average, over 50% of the
          costs of a software system are spent on system change after the system
          has been deployed (Jones, 2008). For large systems, this proportion
          may be as high as 80%. Therefore, if you are involved in software
          development, you should expect to spend more time and money on system
          change than on initial development.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Software evolution may be triggered by changing business requirements,
          by reports of software defects, or by changes to other systems in a
          software system’s environment.
          <strong>Hopkins and Jenkins (2008)</strong> coined the term
          <i>‘brownfield software development’</i> to describe situations in
          which software systems have to be developed and managed in an
          environment where they depend on many other software systems.
        </p>
      
        <h2 class="font-bold text-lg">The Spiral Model</h2>
        <p>
          You should, therefore, think of software engineering as a spiral
          process with requirements, design, implementation, and testing going
          on throughout the lifetime of the system.

          This model of software evolution implies that a single organization is
          responsible for both the initial software development and the
          evolution of the software.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, this is often not the case. Many software systems are
          developed by one organization and then sold to another organization
          that is responsible for the evolution of the system. This is true of
          most packaged software systems.

        <h3 class="font-bold">Evolution vs. Servicing</h3>
        <p>
          Rajlich and Bennett (2000) proposed an alternative view of the
          software evolution life cycle, distinguishing between
          <strong>evolution</strong> and <strong>servicing</strong>.

          In this stage, the software moves from evolution to servicing. During the servicing phase, the software is still useful and used but only small tactical changes are
           made to it. During this stage, the company is usually considering how the software
           can be replaced. In the final stage, phase-out, the software may still be used but no
           further changes are being implemented. Users have to work around any problems
           that they discover.
