    <p>
      Program evolution dynamics is the study of system change. 
      In the 1970s and 1980s, Lehman and Belady (1985) carried out 
      several empirical studies of system change with a view to 
      understanding more about characteristics of software evolution. 
      The work continued in the 1990s as Lehman and others investigated
      the significance of feedback in evolution processes (Lehman, 1996;
       Lehman et al., 1998; Lehman et al., 2001). From these studies, 
       they proposed ‘Lehman’s laws’ concerning system change (Figure 9.7).
      </p>

    <p> 
      Lehman and Belady claim these laws are likely to be true for all
      types of large organizational software systems (what they call
      E-type systems). These are systems in which the requirements are 
      changing to reflect changing business needs. New releases of the 
      system are essential for the system to provide business value.
      </p>

    <p>
      The first law states that system maintenance is an inevitable process. 
      As the system’s environment changes, new requirements emerge and the 
      system must be modified. When the modified system is reintroduced to the
      environment, this promotes more environmental changes, so the evolution process starts again.
      </p>

    <p>
      The second law states that, as a system is changed, its structure
       is degraded. The only way to avoid this happening is to invest in 
       preventative maintenance. You spend time improving the software 
       structure without adding to its functionality. Obviously, this means
        additional costs, over and above those of implementing required system changes

    <p>
      The third law is, perhaps, the most interesting and the most contentious
      of Lehman’s laws. It suggests that large systems have a dynamic of their
      own that is established at an early stage in the development process.
      This determines the gross trends of the system maintenance process and
      limits the number of possible system changes. Lehman and Belady suggest
      that this law is a consequence of structural factors that influence and 
      constrain system change, and organizational factors that affect the evolution process.
        </p>

    <p>
      The structural factors that affect the third law come from the complexity
       of large systems. As you change and extend a program, its structure tends
        to degrade. This is true of all types of system (not just software) and
        it occurs because you are adapting a structure intended for one purpose
        for a different purpose. This degradation, if unchecked, makes it more 
        and more difficult to make further changes to the program. Making small
        changes reduces the extent of structural degradation and so lessens the 
        risks of causing serious system dependability problems. If you try and
        make large changes, there is a high probability that these will introduce 
        new faults. These then inhibit further program changes.
        </p>

    <p>
      The organizational factors that affect the third law reflect the fact
      that large systems are usually produced by large organizations. These 
      companies have internal bureaucracies that set the change budget for
      each system and control the decision making process. Companies have 
      to make decisions on the risks and value of the  changes and the costs 
      involved. Such decisions take time to make and, sometimes, it takes 
      longer to decide on the changes to be made than change implementation. 
      The speed of the organization’s decision-making processes therefore
      governs the rate of change of the system.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lehman’s fourth law suggests that most large programming projects 
      work in a ‘saturated’ state. That is, a change to resources or 
      staffing has imperceptible effects on the long-term evolution of 
      the system. This is consistent with the third law, which suggests 
      that program evolution is largely independent of management decisions. 
      This law confirms that large software development teams are often 
      unproductive because communication overheads dominate the work of the team.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lehman’s fifth law is concerned with the change increments in each 
      system release. Adding new functionality to a system inevitably introduces 
      new system faults. The more functionality added in each release, the more
       faults there will be. Therefore, a large increment in functionality in 
       one system release means that this will have to be followed by a further 
       release in which the new system faults are repaired. Relatively little new
        functionality should be included in this release. This law suggests that
         you should not budget for large functionality increments in each release
          without taking into account the need for fault repair.
        </p>

    <p>
      The first five laws were in Lehman’s initial proposals; the remaining 
      laws were added after further work. The sixth and seventh laws are 
      similar and essentially say that users of software will become increasingly 
      unhappy with it unless it is maintained and new functionality is added to it. 
      The final law reflects the most recent work on feedback processes, although
       it is not yet clear how this can be applied in practical software development.
      </p>

    <p>
      Lehman’s observations seem generally sensible. They should be taken into 
      account when planning the maintenance process. It may be that business 
      considerations require them to be ignored at any one time. For example, 
      for marketing reasons, it may be necessary to make several major system 
      changes in a single release. The likely consequences of this are that one
       or more releases devoted to error repair are likely to be required. You
        often see this in personal computer software when a major new release 
        of an application is often quickly followed by a bug repair update.
